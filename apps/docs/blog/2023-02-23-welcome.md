This is the start of the documentation/public website of the CSL project. The long-term idea of the project is to create a versatile tool for schools to use in their daily tasks relating to student activities. At the current state, two features are available: shop and events. In the next few months, we will work to introduce a "News" section and to migrate to the full power of [Next 13](https://nextjs.org/13), which will allow us to develop fundamental features to make the final vision of the project work.

If you find the project interesting, please consider giving us a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/LuckeeDev/csl).
