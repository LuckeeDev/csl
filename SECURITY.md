## Supported Versions

Version 2 is the WIP version and the only supported one. Version 1 was specifically made for my school, so it's not advisable to use its code in production.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |
